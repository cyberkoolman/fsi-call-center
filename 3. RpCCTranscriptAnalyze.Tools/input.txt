Hello, this is Ronnie Hall from Contoso Services. How can I help you today? Hi, I'm James Brown. I ordered a package 10 days ago on August 10th. It was supposed to arrive in three business days. I've called three times already and each time nobody could write any more information. I want to know where the package is and I need to know now. Look, this is by first the worst service I had any from any vendor. I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Brown. I understand your frustration. I'm here to help. Can you please provide me with your order number so I can look it up? Yes, it's ADF456. Thank you. I'm looking into it right now. Can you please hold on for a few moments while I look check into the status of your package? Sure. Thank you for your patience. I'm so sorry to inform you, but I'm unable to find the status of your package. It appears to have left the left the sending address, but no up-to-date status on the correct current location. I'll call FedEx and track the package to get back and get back to you as soon as I can. Uh, not again. Anyway, my phone number is 212-555-1144. I apologize again for the inconvenience. I promise to give you a call as soon as I can with the correct information. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No. Thank you, Mr. Brown. I have a great day.
