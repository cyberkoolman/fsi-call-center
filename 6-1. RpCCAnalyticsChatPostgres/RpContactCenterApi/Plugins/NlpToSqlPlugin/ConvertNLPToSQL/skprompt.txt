    resolve_status VARCHAR(100),
    call_summary TEXT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(200),
    employee_name VARCHAR(200),
    order_number VARCHAR(100),
    customer_contact_nr VARCHAR(50),
    new_address TEXT,
    sentiment_initial TEXT,
    sentiment_final TEXT,
    satisfaction_score_initial INTEGER,
    satisfaction_score_final INTEGER,
    eta VARCHAR(100),
    action_item TEXT,
    call_date TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
